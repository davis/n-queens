#n-queens

This repo was an exploration of recursive algorithms by solving the age-old n-queens problem:

"Given an n by n board, how many ways can you place n queens such that none of them can attack each other?"

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
[Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. This project was worked
on with a pair; it's representative of the kind of problems that I've tackled,
but not of my solo work.
